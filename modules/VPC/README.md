## The AWS VPC module automates the provisioning of a Virtual Private Cloud along with public and private subnets. It simplifies the process of setting up a network architecture on AWS. The module creates the following resources:

1. VPC
2. Public subnets with Internet Gateway for public-facing resources
3. Private subnets for resources that should not be directly accessible from the internet
4. Route tables for routing traffic within the VPC
5. Route table associations to associate subnets with their respective route tables
